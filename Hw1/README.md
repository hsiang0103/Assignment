# Problem
The goal of this problem is to convert a 32-bit signed integer into a single-precision floating-point number, following the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point representation. This involves translating the integer into its equivalent floating-point bit representation, which consists of three components: the sign bit, the exponent, and the mantissa.
